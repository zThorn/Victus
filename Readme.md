##What is Victus?
Victus is a procedurally generated near-infinite first person exploration game, written in Java using LibGDX.  Victus makes use of existing raycasting rendering techniques in order to generate a "nostalgic" experience, similar to those seen in Wolfenstein 3D and Doom.  The goal of Victus is exploration and survival through a complex labyrinth.  What you discover and accomplish within Victus is up to the player entirely, and we aim to make a unique experience on each playthrough.
